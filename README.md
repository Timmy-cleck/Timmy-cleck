ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Timothy Ohimah Emmanuel
I am from Nigeria, and I focus on web development. I have a strong passion for learning languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I love getting involved in different projects. In addition to coding, I also like to write Computer Science BSc projects because it allows me to delve deeply into challenging subjects and clearly communicate my ideas.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS
