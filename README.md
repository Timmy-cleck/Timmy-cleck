- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Timothy Ohimah Emmanuel

From Nigeria, and I focus on web development. 
I have a strong passion for learning languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I love getting involved in different projects. 
Alongside coding, I also enjoy writing Computer Science BSc projects, where I can dive deep into complex topics and express my ideas clearly.
